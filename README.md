## About
Traffic Light Automation is an intelligent solution for managing traffic using AI technology, promising comfort and efficiency on the road. By leveraging Computer Vision, this system automatically adjusts traffic light durations based on real-time conditions, creating smoother, more efficient, and eco-friendly traffic flow. It is a step towards a safe and sustainable smart city.
> Note: However, this project is not yet fully completed and still has some bugs. It was developed as a final project for an Artificial Intelligence course, and thus only reaches the stage of counting the number of passing vehicles..
